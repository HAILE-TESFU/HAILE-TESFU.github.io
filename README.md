THE EGG PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE Here is how the simple egg programming language works. It takes a piece of text as an argument.

 PARSING: A parser is a program that reads a piece of text and produces a data structure that reflects the structure of the program contained in that text. If the text does not form a valid program, the parser should point out the error.

 Function parseExpression: This function works the type of syntax tree for the corresponding characters in the argument string. Depending on the type of binding, string, number and application.

 Function skipSpace: The skipSpace function works on the on each character of the argument character which are to be skipped or to be deducted after determining it data structure.

 Function parseApply: The parse apply works on the type of to keep the data structure or syntax tree got from the parseExpression and sends it to the parse function if it is proper language.

 Function parse: determines if it is a proper data structure or syntax tree.

 EVALUATOR: The evaluator evaluates the egg language is working properly. It gives a syntax tree and evaluates its corresponding string. It uses the egg language to run different types of syntax tree.

I have completed all the questions except the last questions the last to be printed in the text area.
